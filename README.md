# Diffie Hellman Key Exchange Project

**Context**: final High School Project (final grade: 100 / 100 cum laude)

**Main goal of the script**: creating a graphical interface that allows to encrypt and decrypt .txt files, using an algorithm studied during the last year of High School (Diffie–Hellman key exchange: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange).

**How to use the file .py**:

 1. In the menu, open the “DH Projecty.py” file and run the code
 2. Select “Open & Encrypt” and then select “Example.txt”
 3. Wait for the encryption
 4. Select “Save file as” and name it “Enc.txt”
 5. Select “Open & Decrypt” and then select “Enc.txt”
 6. The newly created *-decrypted* file should contain the same content as
    “Example.txt”
